<h1 align="center">👋 Hi, I’m Gavin.</h1>
Welcome to my github page, home to all my digital experiments and failures (all documented of course!). I try to Union design and technology<br>
- 👀 I’m interested in simplicity in all facets of life. If there is a principle to design, it would be "less is more."<br>
- 🌱 I’m currently learning "Great Economist: Classical Economics and its Forerunners"<br>
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on full stack problems<br>
- 📫 How to reach me - send me an email. I'll read it if its well intentioned and if I have time.
✨Have a nice day!✨
